# About HelpFull
We've all done some community service involvement in our lives, either to show in our college application when we are in high school or a requirement/extra credits for our class when we are in college, and most people stopped after they graduated. Lending a helping hand shouldn't be a requirement, but to Help simply because you want to. 

Volunteering is something that has no time limit; you can volunteer as much or as little as youâ€™d like or have time for and still feel some type of fulfillment from it.

- **Why?**
Volunteerism helps to build and promote a positive culture within a company and can also influence teamwork in the workplace. The more employees you can bring onboard a CSR program the bigger impact it will have, since those that participate are more likely to rate their job satisfaction as high. </br>
